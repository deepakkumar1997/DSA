BinarySearch Algorithm for a sorted array

Algorithm BinarySearch(l, h, key){ 
    while(l <= h){
        mid = (l+h)/2 // mid will take floor value
        if(key == Arr[mid])
            return mid;
        else if(key < A{mid})
            h = mid-1;
        else l = mid+1;
    }
}

Where,
l   = low(lowest index of sorted array)
h   = high(highest index of sorted array)
key = element to be searched
mid = (l+h)/2 and mid will take floor value(because array index represented as an integer index)

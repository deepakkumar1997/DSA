> A program is a set of instructions which perform operations on data so data is 
  important part of a program withou it operations can't be performed;

> So when a program dealing with the data and how it will organize the data in main
  memory that is called data structure;

> The way you organize the data in main memory during execution time of a program 
  that is called data structure;

> Type of data structure:

    > Physical DS:
        > Array
        > Linked List

    > Logical DS:
        > Linear DS:
            > Stack
            > Queue
        > Non-linear DS:
            > Tree
            > Graph
        > Linear or Tabular DS:
            > Hash Table

> Physical data structures are used or actually meant for storing the data in memory;
> How you are going to insert or delete data from these physical data structures is 
  defined using these logical data structures and we call it a Discipline;
  like LIFO is a discipline of Stack;
> Logical data structures are implemented by using physical data structure;

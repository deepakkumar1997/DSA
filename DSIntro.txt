> Data is an integral(essential) part of our application or programs;
> Program: It is a set of instructions which perform operations on data to get some
           results;
> So without data there is no need of or no use of an instruction;

> What is data structure?
> Data structure can be defined as arrangement of collection of data items so that 
  they can be used efficiently; Operations on data can be done efficiently; So, 
  It is all about arrangement of data and efficient operations on data;

> But question is where we will do all these things like arrangement of data,
  efficient operations on data?
> So we'll all these things "Inside the main memory during execution of a program";
> So every application will have set of instruction which can perform operations on
  data so data is mandatory; Then where the data is kept "Inside the main memory"
  where the programs will be "Inside the main memory";

*> During execution of the program how the program manage the data inside the main
   memory and perform the operations that is data structure;

> Every program's instruction and data must brought into main memory in order of 
  use it and while execting the application how data is arranged and how it is 
  efficiently used that is called data structure;

> Data structure is a part of running program;

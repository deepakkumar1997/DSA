> Data is an integral(essential) part of our application or programs;
> Program: It is a set of instructions that perform operations on data to get some
           results;
> So without data there is no need for or no use of an instruction;

> What is data structure?
> Data structure can be defined as an arrangement of a collection of data items so that 
  they can be used efficiently; Operations on data can be done efficiently; So, 
  It is all about the arrangement of data and efficient operations on data;

> But the question is where we will do all these things like the arrangement of data,
  efficient operations on data?
> So we'll all these things "Inside the main memory during execution of a program";
> So every application will have a set of instructions that can perform operations on
  data so data is mandatory; Then where the data is kept "Inside the main memory"
  where the programs will be "Inside the main memory";

*> During the execution of the program how does the program manage the data inside the main
   memory and perform the operations that are data structure;

> Every program's instruction and data must be brought into the main memory in order of 
  use it and while executing the application how data is arranged and how it is 
  efficiently used that is called data structure;

> Data structure is a part of running the program;

> Types of data structures:
    > Physical DS
    > Logical DS 

> Physical Data Structures:
    > Array
    > Linked List

> Physical DS is meant for storing/holding the data in the memory;

> Logical Data Structures:
    > Linear DS:
        > Stack (LIFO)
        > Queues(FIFO)
    > Non-linear DS:
        > Trees
        > Graph
    > Linear or Tabular DS:
        > Hash Tables 

> Discipline means how you're going to insert the data, delete the data comes under these
  logical data structures;
> These logical data structures are implemented using physical data structures either 
  array or linked list and sometimes both;

> What is data type?
> A data is defined as 
    > Representation of data(How you storing the data)
    > Operation on data(What are the operation allowed on data)
> If an integer takes 2 bytes of memory then it has 16 bits of space to fill it but
  1st bit is for sign bit(for representing +ve and -ve nums);

> Operation allowed on an integer type: +,-,*,%,/,++,--

> What is abstract?
> Abstract means hiding internal details;

> So in the above example we've seen that on an integer data type, many operations can be
  performed and how integer data type is represented in memory but for performing
  these operations to integer data type we don't need to know what's going on behind
  that details are hidden so that it is called an abstract data type;

> When you create a class and you've data representation and operations on data 
  together then your class becomes an abstract data type;

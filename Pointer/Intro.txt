***************************** {Pointer} **********************************
> Pointer is an address variable which contains address of another variable of same
  type;
> Normal variables are data variables which contains data but pointers are address
  variables which contains address of another variable of same type;

> Pointers are used for accessing data indirectly;

> Why we actually need pointers?
> The policy of a program is that a program can directly access stack memory but not
  heap memory; So heap memory is external or outside of the program, so program does
  not directly access, and for that we needs pointer so one of the reason we need 
  pointer to access heap memory in our program, and we all know that dynamic memory
  is created in heap memory;
> So a pointer variable exist in stack memory and it have address of data which is 
  in heap memory;
> So pointer is used to access the resources which is outside of the program and one
  of them is resources in heap memory;
> One more external resource is hard disk so getting data from hard disk we can use
  pointers;
> Heap memory, HDD, moniter, keyboard, network(internet) these are all external
  resources so we can access all these using pointer;

> So one major usage of pointer is accessing resources which is outside of the program;

> Pointer is also used for parameter passing;

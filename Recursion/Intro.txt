> A function is calling itself then it is called a recursive function;

Prototype:

Type fun(param){
    if(<baseCondition>){
        ...
        fun(param); //recursive calls
        ...
    }
}

>> Working on a recursion code:

void fun1(int n){
    if(n>0){
        printf("%d",n);
        fun1(n-1);
    }
}
void main(){
    int x=3;
    fun1(x);
}
